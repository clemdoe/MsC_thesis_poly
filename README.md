## ðŸ“Œ Overview  
This repository contains all data, code, and postprocessing scripts related to my thesis:  
- **GeN-Foam** simulations (including input and output).  
- **Custom code** THMprototype to model the thermohydraulics of BWR  
- **Postprocessing** scripts generating figures in the thesis.  
- **Comparison data** between GeN-Foam and the prototype

## ðŸ—‚ Folder Structure  
- `0_THMprototype/`: developed to model the themrohydraulics of BWR.  
- `1_GeNFoam/`: simulations input and output files.  
- `2_Output/`: scripts generating figures in the thesis and output of the GeN-Foam to compare GeN-Foam and THMprototype.
- `3_Version5/`: the updated Version5 code to port the code THM_prototype to the THM: module of Donjon5
- `4_Figures/`: figures showed in my thesis.
- `5_docs/`: Thesis PDF and supporting references (publications, documentation).

## ðŸ›  How to Reproduce Results  
### GeN-Foam Simulations
1. Install the dependancies mentionned in requirement.txt
2. Check the paths for the GeNFoam comparison, the relative path should be: `your_absolute_path/1_GeNFoam/test_case_studied`
3. Change the abosolute paths to save your figures from mine to yours.
4. Run cases from `0_THMprototype/` with your python installation. You may need jupyter notebook. Without jupyter notebook you will need to copy paste the code in a .py file.

#### Run new GeN_Foam simulations
1. Install and compile GeN-Foam (see [official documentation](https://gitlab.com/foam-for-nuclear/GeN-Foam)).
2. Copy the studied case from 1_GeNFoam/` to your local GeN-Foam installation
3. Your can modified the properties inside the different sub folders
4. Run with ./Allrun
